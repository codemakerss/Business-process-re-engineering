# Business-process-re-engineering
Intend to give an overview of how business process re-engineering process works

# Re-engineering Process
  
This is a **NOTE** learning from [*BPR Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPM7PBNVaLM&t=117s)
  
## Business Process Re-engineering
  
- organize around outcomes, not tasks
- output of the process perform the process (self-service)
- capture information once and at the source
- use information to support those poeple in the real work 
- put decision points where the work is performed and build controls into the process
- link parallel activities instead of integrating their results
- treat gepgraphically dispersed resources as though they were centralized
  
## Decision Points
Centralization vs. Decentralization
  
for example:
  
industry -> pricing -> purchasing -> distribution
  
1. complete decentralization
2. centralized pricing and decentralized purchasing
3. centralized purchasing and warehousing
4. centralized purchasing with local distribution
  
## BPR Framework
```html
1. Technology
   Enabling technologies
   IS architectures
   Methods and tools
   IS organizations
2. Process
   Core business processes
   Value-added
   Customer-focus
   Innovation
3. Organization
   Job skills
   Structures
   Reward
   Values
```
  
## BPR Lift Cycle
```html
1. Visioning - define corporate visions and business goals

2. Identifying - core business process we are going to re-engieering

The first two steps are Enterprise-wide enginnering, after finishing first two,
we can then proceed the process

3. Analyzing - analyze and measure an existing process

4. Redesigning - identify enabling IT & generate alternative process redesigns

5. Evaluating - evaluate and select a process redesign

6. Implementing - Implement the reenginnered process 


7. Improving - continuous improvement of the process

** Manage change and stakeholder interets **
```
  
## Criteria for Selecting Processes

- Broken 
- Cross-functional units
- Core processes that have high impacts
- Front-line and customer serving - the moment of truth
- Value-adding
- New processes and services
- Feasible
  
## Process Data
```html
Basic Overall process data

we may have to take care about:
customers and their requirements / 
suppliers and their qualifications /
business goals we want to achieve /
performance characteristic, such as cost, cycle time, reliability and defect rate /
systems constrains, such as budget, business, legal, social, environment, and safety issues and constraints

Measure critical process metrics

cycle time - cost - inqut and output quality - frequency and distribution of inputs
```
  
## Resigning

identify enabling IT & generate alternative process redesigns

## Evaluation Criteria for Design Alternatives
```
Costs : 

Design and implementing the business process
Hire and train employee
Develop supporting IS
Purchase of other equipment and facilities

Benefits :

Customer requirements
Breakthrough goals
Performance criteria
Constraints

Risk :

Technology avaliability and maturity
Time required for design and implementation
Learning curve
Cost and schedule overrun
```
  
## Customer Perspective
```
they don't care about the middle process and front-line will be really critical parts for dealing with customers issues, so that we need manager to train those employees well 
```
  
```html
1. The Customer 			Identify Customers& Define Outcomes
2. Activities / Tasks		Redesign Outputs
3. Functions / Processes	Determine Activities/Processes
4. Organization				Define Job Responsibilities 
5. Management				Develop Organization Structures
```
