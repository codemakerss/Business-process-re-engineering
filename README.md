# Business-process-re-engineering
Intend to give an overview of how business process re-engineering process works

# Re-engineering Process
  
This is a **NOTE** learning from [*BPR Video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPM7PBNVaLM&t=117s)
  
## Business Process Re-engineering
  
- organize around outcomes, not tasks
- output of the process perform the process (self-service)
- capture information once and at the source
- use information to support those poeple in the real work 
- put decision points where the work is performed and build controls into the process
- link parallel activities instead of integrating their results
- treat gepgraphically dispersed resources as though they were centralized
  
## Decision Points
Centralization vs. Decentralization
  
for example:
  
industry -> pricing -> purchasing -> distribution
  
1. complete decentralization
2. centralized pricing and decentralized purchasing
3. centralized purchasing and warehousing
4. centralized purchasing with local distribution
  
## BPR Framework
```html
1. Technology
   Enabling technologies
   IS architectures
   Methods and tools
   IS organizations

2. Process
   Core business processes
   Value-added
   Customer-focus
   Innovation
   
3. Organization
   Job skills
   Structures
   Reward
   Values
```
  
## BPR Lift Cycle
```html
1. Visioning - define corporate visions and business goals

2. Identifying - core business process we are going to re-engieering

The first two steps are Enterprise-wide enginnering, after finishing first two,
we can then proceed the process

3. Analyzing - analyze and measure an existing process

4. Redesigning - identify enabling IT & generate alternative process redesigns

5. Evaluating - evaluate and select a process redesign

6. Implementing - Implement the reenginnered process 


7. Improving - continuous improvement of the process

** Manage change and stakeholder interets **
```
  
## Criteria for Selecting Processes

- Broken 
- Cross-functional units
- Core processes that have high impacts
- Front-line and customer serving - the moment of truth
- Value-adding
- New processes and services
- Feasible
  
## Process Data
```
Basic Overall process data

we may have to take care about:

customers and their requirements 
suppliers and their qualifications
business goals we want to achieve 
performance characteristic, such as cost, cycle time, reliability and defect rate 
systems constrains, such as budget, business, legal, social, environment, and 
safety issues and constraints

Measure critical process metrics

cycle time - cost - inqut and output quality - frequency and distribution of inputs
```
  
## Resigning

identify enabling IT & generate alternative process redesigns

## Evaluation Criteria for Design Alternatives
```
Costs : 

Design and implementing the business process
Hire and train employee
Develop supporting IS
Purchase of other equipment and facilities

Benefits :

Customer requirements
Breakthrough goals
Performance criteria
Constraints

Risk :

Technology avaliability and maturity
Time required for design and implementation
Learning curve
Cost and schedule overrun
```
  
## Customer Perspective
```
they don't care about the middle process and front-line will be really critical parts for dealing with customers issues, so that we need manager to train those employees well 
```
  
```html
1. The Customer 			Identify Customers& Define Outcomes
2. Activities / Tasks		        Redesign Outputs
3. Functions / Processes	        Determine Activities/Processes
4. Organization				Define Job Responsibilities 
5. Management				Develop Organization Structures
```
